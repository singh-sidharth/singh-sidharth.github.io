Allow users to add new customers. The project is a basic Spring Application with React. It allows its customers to login and create others customers. Customer details are maintained in a PostgreSQL databse while the image is uploaded to a S3 bucket. The db only stores the key of the uploaded image. Nothing too fancy!

The deployment and building is done through GitHub Actions. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is targetted deployment environment.
