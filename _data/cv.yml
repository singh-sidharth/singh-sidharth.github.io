    - title: Serverless vs Serverful Performance of an Ecommerce Application
      year: 2023
      description:
        - Performed system design and architected cloud solution
        - Effectively communicated trade-offs between different solutions
        - Deployed serverless and serverful MongoDB and AmazonRDS
        - Utilized gRPC and Go to perform inter-service communication
        - Architected multicloud database solution as GCP didn't support serverless database
        - title: Observations
          contents:
            - p50 response time is faster for serverless
            - p95 and p99 response times are quicker by approximately 25% and 10.7% for serverful
            - One possible explanation for these disparities could be the varying resource allocation in serverless, as resources are often shared among multiple functions
